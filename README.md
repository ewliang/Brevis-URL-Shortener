# Brevis - The Modern URL Shortener Webapp
Developed by Eric Liang

Brevis is a URL Shortening webapp created using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and NuxtJS (MEVN stack). The name "brevis" is the Latin term for "short", which represents the functionality of a URL "short"ening webapp after all!

NOTE:
- This is NOT made with Bitly API or any URL Shortening APIs from any URL Shortening Sites.
- I made this for the sake of fun and practice. I didn't focus too much on security of the webapp, so use at your own risk if you plan to release this into a production environment. You are responsible for anything that happens.
